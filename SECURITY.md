# üîí Security Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the LA777 Casino Management System.

## Critical Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. **Exposed Firebase Service Account Key** ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue**: Private key was hardcoded in `serviceAccountKey.json`
- **Fix**: Moved to environment variables and added to `.gitignore`
- **Impact**: Prevents unauthorized access to Firebase Admin SDK

### 2. **Exposed Firebase API Key** ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue**: API key was hardcoded in multiple files
- **Fix**: Moved to environment variables
- **Impact**: Prevents API abuse and unauthorized access

### 3. **Open Firestore Security Rules** ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue**: `allow read, write: if true` allowed anyone to access all data
- **Fix**: Implemented role-based access control
- **Impact**: Protects sensitive casino data

### 4. **Sensitive Data Logging** ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue**: Passwords and sensitive data were logged to console
- **Fix**: Removed sensitive data from logs
- **Impact**: Prevents data leakage in logs

## Security Measures Implemented

### üîê Authentication & Authorization
- Firebase Authentication with email/password
- Role-based access control (Super Admin, Agent, Cashier)
- Session management with secure tokens
- Password strength validation

### üõ°Ô∏è Input Validation & Sanitization
- Zod schema validation for all inputs
- HTML/JavaScript injection prevention
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection with content escaping

### üö´ Rate Limiting
- API rate limiting (100 requests/minute per IP)
- Brute force attack prevention
- DDoS protection

### üîí Security Headers
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

### üìÅ File Upload Security
- File type validation (images only)
- File size limits (5MB max)
- Secure file storage with Firebase Storage
- Malware scanning (recommended for production)

### üîç Audit Logging
- Security event logging
- User action tracking
- Failed authentication attempts
- Suspicious activity detection

## Environment Variables Required

Create a `.env.local` file with:

```env
# Firebase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

# Security Settings
NODE_ENV=production
SESSION_SECRET=your-super-secret-session-key
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100
```

## Firebase Security Rules

### Firestore Rules
- Role-based access control
- Staff can only access their own data
- Admins have full access
- Agents have limited access
- Cashiers have payment-specific access

### Storage Rules
- Authenticated users only
- Role-based file access
- Secure file upload/download
- Temporary file cleanup

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. Never commit sensitive files to git
2. Use environment variables for secrets
3. Validate all inputs
4. Sanitize user data
5. Implement proper error handling
6. Use HTTPS in production
7. Regular security audits

### For Deployment
1. Use secure hosting (Vercel, Netlify)
2. Enable HTTPS
3. Set up monitoring and alerting
4. Regular backups
5. Keep dependencies updated
6. Monitor for suspicious activity
